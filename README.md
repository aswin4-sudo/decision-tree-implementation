"A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting data into branches based on feature conditions, forming a tree-like structure. In Google Colab, we implement it using Python libraries like `sklearn` and `pandas`. The dataset is loaded, preprocessed, and trained using `DecisionTreeClassifier` or `DecisionTreeRegressor`. The modelâ€™s decision-making process can be visualized using `plot_tree()`. Finally, performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and other metrics. Decision trees are widely used for their simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency in handling complex data."
